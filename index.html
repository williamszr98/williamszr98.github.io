          <h1> Introduction to the Big Mac Index </h1>

            The Big Mac Index was introduced by The Economist in 1986 as an alternative way to illustrate purchasing
            power parity (PPP).
            PPP is the concept that market exchange rates between countries may not always accurately reflect the true
            value of currencies due to various uncontrolled factors.
            <br>The Big Mac Index helps us get a better sense of what PPP might actually be.
            <br><br>
            Given that McDonald's is the largest fast food chain globally, its ubiquitous presence makes the Big Mac an
            ideal standard for comparison across countries.

            It also has the advantage of having the same inputs and distribution system, with a few minor modifications
            (like chicken patties in India instead of beef).

          <div class="title">The Big Mac Index and Currency Strength</div>
          <p>Here we can see the equation being worked out and displayed in a lollipop graph.</p>
          <p>Our lollipop graph visually represents this by marking currencies in green if they are overvalued and in red if they are undervalued. We identify which currencies are stronger or weaker relative to the US dollar by hovering over them.</p>
          <p>Use the date selection dropdown to view how these valuations have changed over time. This allows you to see trends and fluctuations in currency strength, providing insights into economic conditions and market behaviors.:</p>

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Purchasing Power Parity</div>
          <p> We mentioned before that the Big Mac Index can be used as a measure of Purchasing Power polarity.
            <br><br>
            Our scatter plot displays Big Mac prices versus GDP per capita. We can see how the cost of a Big Mac correlates with the economic wealth of a country.
            Higher GDP per capita generally correlates with higher Big Mac prices, reflecting higher living costs in wealthier countries.
            <br>
            <p>Switzerland's Big Mac seems to to not be affected that much by the GDP, but they also have the most expensive Big Mac in the world.</p>
            Use the dropdown menu to filter and compare different countries.

          <div class="title">Big Mac Prices Throughout the Years</div>
          <p>Here we can explore the prices of the Big Mac for different country.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Most countries exhibit a consistent increase in Big Mac prices over the years, reflecting inflation and rising costs. However, some countries may show more variability due to economic instability or currency fluctuations.</p>

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Historical Trends</div>
          The Big Mac pricing data can be used to see major world events and economic impacts
          <br><br>
          <p>Like here, we can see a huge spike in pricing from 2014 to 2017 due to the Russian financial crisis.
            A loss of confidence in the Russian economy prompted investors to offload their Russian assets, resulting in
            a drop in the value of the Russian rouble.
            <br><br>
            A decline in the value of the Russian rouble typically makes imported goods more expensive due to the higher
            cost of foreign currency.
            Since some ingredients for a Big Mac might be imported, this might be one of the reason why the price spiked
            so much.

          <div class="title">Conclusion</div>
          <p>
            In summary, the Big Mac Index offers a fascinating way to grasp the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
            by comparing the price of a Big Mac across different countries. This simple yet powerful tool helps us
            understand how currencies measure up against each other, not just on paper but in real-world terms.
            <br><br>
            Throughout this exploration, we've seen how the Big Mac Index reveals the relative strength of currencies
            and provides insights into broader economic conditions. It highlights how currency values can be over or
            undervalued and showcases the impact of significant global events on pricing. For instance, the spike in Big
            Mac prices during the Russian financial crisis illustrates how currency devaluation can affect the cost of
            everyday items.
            <br><br>
            By visualizing these trends and fluctuations, we gain a clearer picture of how economic policies and global
            events shape the prices we pay. The Big Mac Index, while simple in concept, gives us a tangible way to
            understand complex economic dynamics and their real-world implications.
