          <h1> Big Mac prices overtime </h1>

            The Big Mac Index was invented by The Economist in 1986.
            It is intended to be a lighthearted way to demonstrate the concept of purchasing power parity.
            In other words, it helps illustrate the idea that market exchange rates between countries may be "out of
            whack" when compared to the cost of buying the same basket of goods and services in those places.

            Given that McDonald’s is one of the biggest companies in the world and the Big Mac is widely available
            globally, it means that the famous burger can be used as a basic goods comparison between most countries. It
            also has the advantage of having the same inputs and distribution system, with a few minor modifications
            (like chicken patties in India instead of beef).
