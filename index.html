          <h1> Big Mac prices overtime </h1>

            The Big Mac Index was invented by The Economist in 1986.
            It is intended to be a lighthearted way to demonstrate the concept of purchasing power parity.
            In other words, it helps illustrate the idea that market exchange rates between countries may be "out of
            whack" when compared to the cost of buying the same basket of goods and services in those places.

            Given that McDonaldâ€™s is one of the biggest companies in the world and the Big Mac ubiquitous around the world, 
            it means that the famous burger can be used as a basic goods comparison between most countries. It
            also has the advantage of having the same inputs and distribution system, with a few minor modifications
            (like chicken patties in India instead of beef).

          <p> We  mentioned before that the Big Mac Index can be used as a measure of Purchasing Power polarity.

            Here we can see a scatter Plot of Big Mac Prices vs. GDP per Capita
            <br>
            You can also see that the cost of a Big Mac goes up with the GDP of the nation
